# CSE 310 - Course Report

Name:

## Part 1 - Semester Planning

This section should be filled out during Week 1 and submitted.

### Section 1.1 - Module Planning

During this course you get to decide what technologies and languages you want to learn.  After looking at the Module Description document in Canvas, select 5 modules that interest you.  You will be responsible for learning the material and creating software to demonstrate what you learned.  The software that you write will be placed in your personal software portfolio. You can change you mind later in the course based on your experiences.  Try to select modules that stretch your current abilities.  

You will work on one module in every 2 week Sprint.  During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Mark only one "X" in each of the five columns.  The "Choose Your Own Adventure" can only be selected starting in Sprint 3.

### Section 1.2 - Goal Setting

Every Sprint you will be setting a goal to improve one of your learning skills.  Learning technology is fun.  However, we don't want to neglect learning how to learn better.  Your ability to use new technology and handle difficult situations will improve as you give attention to your learning skills.

1. Complete the following Learning Skill Survey:

|Learning Skill Survey (3=Frequently, 2=Sometimes, 1=Rarely |           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|

2. Based on your resonses in the survey above, pick one area that you want to improve.  Write a "Small and Simple" goal to improve in this area throughout the semester.  Write your goal below:


## Part 2 - Semester Conclusion

This section should be filled out during Week 14 and submitted.

After a long semester of learning new things, its good to pause and consider what you experienced.  You learned many new technologies and languages on your own.  You have the capability to continue to do this outside of school. Sprint 6 and beyond is in your hands.

1. As you have worked individually and as a team to develop your personal software portfolio, how have your technical skills improved?


2. Identify at least one technology or language you learned this semester that you want to continue to improve after this course.  What is your next step?


3. Look back at the goal you wrote at the beginning of the semester (Part 1 above).  What was the result of your goal?  Did your goal change during the semester?  What do you want to work on next to improve your ability to learn?
