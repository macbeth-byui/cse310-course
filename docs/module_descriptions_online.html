        <h1>Module Descriptions</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>In this course, you will select 6 modules to complete individually. Available modules are listed at the bottom of this page.</p>

        <p>Each module will require you to use your current programming knowledge to learn new languages, tools, techniques, and libraries. You should select modules that you have little or now experience with.  If you want to build your knowledge in something you have already done before, you can ask your teacher for permission.  Additionally, you can build upon software written from a previous module. For example, over three modules you could first learn Kotlin, then create an Android app with that Kotlin code, and then finally you can connect your Android app with a cloud database like Firestore.</p>

        <p>Each module will be completed in a two week Sprint. You will need to submit a plan on the Wednesday of the first week. During the Sprint you will need to keep track of how much time you spend working on your module. By the end of the second week, you will need to submit your demonstration software for the module. Your module will be graded based on both requirements listed below and time expectations.</p>

        <h2>Time Expectation</h2>

        <p>Each Sprint you will be expected to spend at least 12 hours working on your module project.  

        <h2>Common Requirements for all Modules</h2>

        <p>The software you write for each module has the following common requirements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>You must write software of your own creation to demonstrate your understanding of the module. Submitting the code you wrote as part of a published tutorial online is not sufficient.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>All code must exceed 100 lines (not including setup) and must be documented with useful comments.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The software must include a README.md file at the top folder of the project. The template for each README.md file written in <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/" target="_blank">Markdown Language</a> is different for each module and is provided in the detailed table below. You must fill out the template completely. This file will be publically viewable in GitHub so make sure to use good spelling, good grammar, and maintain professionalisim.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A 4-5 minute video demonstrating the execution of the software and a walkthrough of the code must be created and uploaded publicly (or unlisted if desired) to a site like YouTube. A link to the video must be included in the README.md file. The video should serve as a training video for someone else to learn what you learned.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>All the code including the README.md file must be published in a public GitHub repository. Each module must be in a <strong>separate GitHub repository</strong>. The name of the repository should reflect the software you wrote (e.g. MenuPlanner) or the technology that you used (e.g. KotlinPractice). Don't use generic names like "Module1" or "CSE310Project2".</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you are modifying software written in a previous module to support your new module, then you should reuse the same GitHub repository. However, the documentation and video need to be updated to reflect the changes made to your software by the new module.</p>

        <h2>Grading</h2>

        <p>Your modules are graded based on the time you spent (minimum of 12 hours), the published demonstration software in GitHub, and documentation including your video. The rubric is very much "checklist-based". Feedback is best obtained during the Sprint while you are working on the project and when you demo your software.  If you would like feedback after the Sprint, it is best to meet with your teacher.  Even though you are being asked to learn the material on your own, your teacher is your coach and mentor.  You can get help at any time on your project.  (The teachers really like it when you ask for help!!)</p>

        <h2>Resources</h2>

        <p>There are many resources available to you to learn material in these modules.  The descriptions below provide some suggested links to consider.  In general, you are expected to use the following resources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Official Reference Websites</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Tutorial Websites</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>AI Tools such as ChatGPT</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Videos from sites like YouTube</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Actual Books from the Library (or E-Book on Safari Online via the McKay Library)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Your teacher, peers, and other knowledgable friends and family</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>In your README file, you will be asked to provide a list of website sources that you found helpful.</p>

                        <p>Cloud data storage is a convenient solution which removes the requirement for an individual or company to maintain their own database server. Tools like <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Firebase</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" target="_blank">Amazon DynamoDB</a>, and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> will provide you a database which you can access using an API (function calls from a library). The use of these cloud databases is frequently free for simple projects, but will cost when scaled up. Cloud databases provide a mix of various types of databases, including relational and key/value. A key/value database (which is recommended in the instructions) will store data into maps that can be queried either in whole, in parts, or in filtered parts. A key/value database is also commonly called a NoSQL database. The APIs for each database will vary and provide these capabilities. </p>

                        <h4>Unique Requirements &amp; Stretch Challenges</h4>
                        <p>Develop software that interacts with a cloud database. The following 5 things must be done:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p>Create a cloud database with at least one table (In Firestore, a table is called a collection).</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Software should query data from the database.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Software should add new data to the database.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Software should update data from the database.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Software should delete data from the database.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        

                        <p>Stretch Challenges (select one):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Receive notifications in your software when data in the cloud changes.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Create two or more tables that are related to each other.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Implement user authentication.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Guidance</h4>
                        <p>You should consider using Python and Firestore (part of Google Firebase) for this module. Here are some useful notes when using this suggested environment:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Use <code>firebase-admin</code> to access a Firestore database from Python. You can use pip to install: <code>pip install firebase-admin</code></p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>You will need to create a free Firebase account, create a Firebase project, and create a Firestore database in the project.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>During the process of getting your account and database set up, you will need to download a Service Account File, which is a JSON file. This file along with the project name will be needed when you initialize your connection to the Firestore database within your code. The Service Account File is secret and should not be shared in the GitHub repository.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Here is a list of websites that you might find useful when working in the suggested environment:</p>

                        <p>As the processing power of computers has increased, the world has become able to capture the large amounts of data that it produces. Surveys, transactions, and observations are captured every hour of every day. A data scientist has the skills to capture, organize, and analyze large amounts of data and look for patterns, trends, and statistical relevance between datasets. Since the possibilities of data analysis are endless, programming languages are used to write customized software to analyze data. Some languages, like R, were designed specifically for data analysis. Libraries like <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">Pandas</a>, <a href="https://pola.rs/" target="_blank">Polars</a>, <a href="https://numpy.org/" target="_blank">NumPy</a>, <a href="https://matplotlib.org/" target="_blank">Matplotlib</a>, <a href="https://scrapy.org/" target="_blank">Scrapy</a>, <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/" target="_blank">BeautifulSoup</a>, and <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank">TensorFlow</a> provide the capabilities to do the analysis with the familar Python programming language.</p>

                        <p>Games bring entertainment and education to many people using their computers and devices. However, we frequently don't realize the software code that is running behind those games. Games have several components to them, including the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>User Interface including Graphics and Sound</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Event Processing (Keyboard, Mouse)</p>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <p>Network, Database and Notifications</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>With so many moving components in a game, it is useful to use a game platform for development.

                        <p>Geographic Information Systems (GIS) involves the organization of information on a map. The information can be physical (cities, landmarks, mountains, trails), economic (median incomes, tax rates, employment), social (gender, ethnicity, family, religion), or event driven (earthquake, lightning, crime, activity). Using maps, decisions can be made, trends can be found, and information can be obtained. The components in GIS include user interfaces, data storage, and analysis.</p>

                        <p>Mobile is everywhere, and the ability to make mobile applications has never been more sought after or desirable than it is now. Android applications are typically written in Java or Kotlin using Android Studio. iOS applications are written in Swift using XCode (using a Mac).</p>

                        <p>Other platforms have been created to make it easier to port to multiple platforms. React Native uses JavaScript to create apps that will run on both platforms. Flutter uses the Dart language to achieve the same result.</p>

                        <h4>Module</h4>
                        <p>Communication between two computers (or even two pieces of software on the same computer) can be done using the networking stack. A network is more than just physical wire (or wireless) that connects a computer to a network; it also includes the data that is transmitted through that connection. The data is organized into layers according to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. These layers include the physical, datalink, network, and transport layers. These layers are used to package, route, and transmit data between computers. Common transport layers include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). On top of all of these layers is the data that we actually want to communicate to another computer. This data is frequently organized by a message structure that both the sending computer and receiving computer understand. Defined formats like JSON, HTML, or XML are all commonly used.</p>

                        <p>Any information can be sent on a network connection. The software could be collaborative (e.g. chat), problem-solving (e.g. provide answer to question), content based (e.g. file or web server), or embedded (e.g. request data from a sensor or turn on a light).</p>

                        <p>When developing networking software, there are two types of models we can look at:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Client-Server: The server receives requests from many clients, processes each one, and sends the responses back to the client.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Peer-to-Peer: A computer (peer) communicates directly to another commputer without going through a server. In this model, there may be a server that is used by a computer to get address information for the other computer.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Guidance</h4>
                        <p>You should consider using Python and standard networking libraries for this module. Here are some useful notes when using this suggested environment:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Python already has libraries to read and write from TCP and UDP sockets and servers. See the links below for information and examples.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>You will need to run two programs (client and server or 2 peers) at the same time to test your software. You can do this on your own computer by using localhost (127.0.0.1) and different port numbers.  You can also use two separate computers.  Another option is that you can consider installing a <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">virtual machine</a> running <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop" target="_blank">Linux</a>.</p>

                        <p>Data can be stored in many different formats. An efficient method for storing information is in a database. One common type of database is a relational database, which organizes the data into tables and relates them together using keys. Libraries have been written to make it easy for the programmer to read and write to and from these databases. Most relational databases support Structured Query Language, or SQL. SQL is a language that allows the programmer to easily interact with the database. Examples of relational databases include the following: , <a href="https://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a>, and <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html" target="_blank">SQLite</a>.</p>

                        <h4>Module</h4>
                        <p>This module will have you create a web app using a framework that will generate web pages dynamically on the host server. Django for Python and Node or React for JavaScript are two common examples of web app frameworks.</p>

                        <p>When a request is made to your web app, the Django framework will call the appropriate Python code (a function in your <code>views.py</code>) file). The Python code will then parse the request and prepare a response. To prepare a response, your code might read a database, download some data from another web server, or perform some calculations. To produce the response, a template HTML file is populated with data created by the Python function. The response is then automatically sent back by the Django framework. Using a framework can reduce the time it takes to create web content. In the case of Django, you also have the benefit of using the Python programming language to process requests.

                        <p>The C++ language is an object-oriented language that is used for embedded and application development. It is based on the C language. C++ requires the use of a compiler and linker, which are operating system– and processor-specific. C++ includes the Standard Template Library (STL), which provides support for data structures and threading.</p>

                        <p>The Java language is an object-oriented language that is used for embedded and application development. Java requires the use of a compiler and a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which can both be obtained by installing the Java Development Kit (JDK). Compiled code (often with a .class or .jar extension) will run on any computer that has a JVM. Java contains a substantial library which includes many classes for data structures (Java Collection Framework), file management, and threading. In Java, every file contains a single class. A static main function is created in one of the classes and is used to provide a starting point for the program.</p>

                        <p>The Kotlin language is an object-oriented language that is used for general application development including Android mobile app development. It is based on the Java language. Kotlin was designed to provide improvements to the Java language while still supporting the Java libraries. Library support includes data structures, file operations, and networking.</p>

                        <h4>Guidance</h4>
                        <p>To set up your development environment for Kotlin, complete the following:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>The Java Development Kit (JDK) is needed since Kotlin is built on top of it. Install the latest version of either <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html" target="_blank">JDK (commercial)</a> or <a href="https://jdk.java.net/" target="_blank">OpenJDK (open source)</a> from Oracle. In industry, there are license considerations between these two options. For your work in this course, either choice is acceptable. </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Install <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank">IntelliJ Idea (Free Community Version)</a>. This is an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Kotlin support will be installed automically. When you create a project in IntelliJ, select "Kotlin" and "JVM | IDEA". When you create files, select "Kotlin File/Class" to create .kt files.</p>
                            </li>

                        <h4>Module</h4>
                        <p>The Erlang language is an example of functional languages like Haskell, F#, and Clojure. Functional languages (unlike the imperative languages you have learned previously) have the following characterstics:</p>

                        <ul>

                            <li>
                                <p>Functions are designed to produce an output from the inputs.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Variables are immutable since functions are only tasked with producing a result. When dealing with data structures, this means that when we add or remove something we will either reuse parts of the previous structure or we will need to recreate parts of the structure.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Since functions are only concerned with the current task and also since variables are immutable, there are no side effects from our code. A side effect occurs when running a funciton or changing a variable affects other variables and functions. Side effects are common in object oriented programming (member functions affect member data).</p>
                            </li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>The goal with functional programming is to write code with higher quality due to the strictness of the language. Like Python, the Erlang language determines variable types automatically. Other languages like Haskell are strictly typed.</p>

                        <p>TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale. TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor. TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.js or Deno and in your apps. TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses type inference to give you great tooling without additional code.</p>

                        <h4>Module</h4>
                        <p>You select the programming language or the type of software to create. This can be useful if there is a language, technology, or library that aligns well with either your major or interests.</p>

                        <h4>Unique Requirements &amp; Stretch Challenges</h4>
                        <p>Like other modules, you will need to write software to demonstrate your capability. It is highly recommend that you communicate with your teacher before submitting your plan to get pre-approval. In your plan you need to identify the requirements you will fulfill. If you are learning a new programming language, you should consider the requirements in the other language modules.</p>

                        <p>This module cannot be done for the first or second module in the course.</p>

                        <p>Note that the module plan must be submitted ahead of time before submitting the final module (e.g you can't submit the plan and the module on the same day as the instructor won't have time to approve of the self-chosen project.)</p>

                        <p>You need to propose a stretch challenge in your plan if you plan on pursuing one.</p>
                        <h4>Guidance</h4>
                        <p>If you want to do this module, it is highly recommended to do it for one of your last modules near the end of the course. You should do initial research and communicate with your teacher at least a week before the plan submittal.</p>
