        <p>Each module will require you to use your current programming knowledge to learn new languages, tools, techniques, and libraries.  During the first week of the course, you completed a Course Plan where you selected the five modules you wanted to complete this semester.  You are allowed to select different modules but you must make sure that the module you select is something that you have not previously learned or used before.</p>
        
        <p>Each module will be completed in a two week period.  By the middle of the first week, you will need to submit a plan.  By the end of the second week, you will need to submit your final product for the module.  Your module will be graded using the <a href="#rubric">Rubric</a> which is based on your compliance to module requirements described below.</p>
        
        <h2>Common Requirements for all Modules</h2>
        
        <p>Each module has the following common requirements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>You must write software of your own creation to demonstrate your understanding of the module.  Submitting the results of completing a published tutorial is not sufficient.</p></li>
            <li><p>The software must be at least 100 lines of code.  In many cases, you will need more than 100 lines to adequantely demonstrate understanding.</p></li>
            <li><p>All code must be documented with useful comments.</p></li>
            <li><p>The software must include a README.md file at the top level of the project.  The template for each README.md file written in <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/" target="_blank">Markdown Language</a> is different for each module and is provided in the detailed table below.  You must fill out the template completely.  This file will be publically viewable in GitHub so make sure has good spelling and grammar and is professional.</p></li>
            <li><p>A 4-5 minute video demonstrating the execution of the software and a walkthrough of the code must be created and uploaded to YouTube.  A link to the video must be included in the README.md file.</p></li>
            <li><p>All the code including the README.md file must be published in a public GitHub repository.  Each module must be in a separate GitHub repository.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Detailed Module Descriptions</h2>
        
        
        <p>The table below provides the unique requirements for each module including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Stretch Challenges - Completion of one of these challenges will earn you bonus points.  You must complete the other requirements to be eligible for bonus points.</p></li>
            <li><p>Guidance - Recommendations for language, library, or tool.  Unless otherwise specified in the requirements, you may use any language, library, or tool.</p></li>
        </ul>

                    <p>Cloud data storage is a convenient solution which removes the requirement for an individual or company to maintain their own database server.  Tools like <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Firebase</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" target="_blank">Amazon DynamoDB</a>, and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> will provide you a database which you can access using an API (function calls from a library).  The use of these cloud databases is frequently free for simple projects, but will cost when scaled up.  Cloud databases provide a mix of various types of databases, including relational and key/value.  A key/value database (which is recommended in the instructions below) will store data into maps that can be queried either in whole, in parts, or in filtered parts.  A key/value database is also commonly called a NoSQL database.  The APIs for each database will vary and provide these capabilities. </p>

                    <p>You should consider using Python and Firestore (part of Google Firebase) for this module.  Here are some useful notes when using this suggested environment:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Use <code>firebase-admin</code> to access a Firebase database from Python.  You can use pip to install: <code>pip install firebase-admin</code></p></li> 
                        <li><p>You will need to create a free Firebase account and create a Firebase Project.  </p></li>
                        <li><p>During the process of getting your account and database set up, you will need to download a Service Account File, which is a JSON file.  This file along with the project name will be needed when you initialize your connection to the Firestore database within your code.  The Service Account File is secret and should not be shared in the GitHub repository.</p></li>

                    <p>As the processing power of computers has increased, the world has become able to capture the large amounts of data that it produces.  Surveys, transactions, and observations are captured every hour of every day.  A data scientist has the skills to capture, organize, and analyze large amounts of data and look for patterns, trends, and statistical relevance between datasets.  Since the possibilities of data analysis are endless, programming languages are used to write customized software to analyze data.  Some languages, like R, were designed specifically for data analysis.  Libraries like <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">Pandas</a>, <a href="https://numpy.org/" target="_blank">NumPy</a>, <a href="https://matplotlib.org/" target="_blank">Matplotlib</a>, <a href="https://scrapy.org/" target="_blank">Scrapy</a>, <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/" target="_blank">BeautifulSoup</a>, and <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank">TensorFlow</a> provide the capabilities to do the analysis with the familar Python programming language.</p>

                    <p>Games bring entertainment and education to many people using their computers and devices.  However, we frequently don't realize the software code that is running behind those games.  Games have several components to them, including the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>User Interface including Graphics and Sound</p></li>
                        <li><p>Event Processing (Keyboard, Mouse)</p></li>
                        <li><p>Game Logic and Story</p></li>
                        <li><p>Network, Database and Notifications</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>With so many moving components in a game, it is useful to use a game platform for development.  There are several inluding  <a href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/" target="_blank">Lumberyard</a>, <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/" target="_blank">Unreal Engine</a>, <a href="https://www.cryengine.com/" target="_blank">Cryengine</a>, and <a href="https://urho3d.github.io/" target="_blank">Urho3D</a>.  Many of these platforms contain professional tools for graphics and animation.  There are also several tools using Python including <a href="https://arcade.academy/" target="_blank">Arcade</a>, <a href="https://www.pygame.org/"  target="_blank">PyGame</a>, <a href="https://kivy.org/"  target="_blank">Kivy</a> and <a href="https://www.panda3d.org/"  target="_blank">Panda3D</a>.</p>

                    <p>Geographic Information Systems (GIS) involves the organization of information on a map.  The information can be physical (cities, landmarks, mountains, trails), economic (median incomes, tax rates, employment), social (gender, ethnicity, family, religion), or event driven (earthquake, lightning, crime, activity).  Using maps, decisions can be made, trends can be found, and information can be obtained.  The components in GIS include user interfaces, data storage, and analysis.</p>

Android is everywhere, and the ability to make Android applications has never been more sought after or desirable than it is now. Android applications are typically written in Java or Kotlin using Android Studio, and while many applications are published to the Google Play Store or other application markets, developers are able to create applications and distribute them without such deployments.

                    <p>Communication between two computers (or even two pieces of software on the same computer) can be done using the networking stack.  A network is more than just physical wire (or wireless) that connects a computer to a network; it also includes the data that is transmitted through that connection.  The data is organized into layers according to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.  These layers include the physical, datalink, network, and transport layers.  These layers are used to package, route, and transmit data between computers.  Common transport layers include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).  On top of all of these layers is the data that we actually want to communicate to another computer.  This data is frequently organized by a message structure that both the sending computer and receiving computer understand.  Defined formats like JSON, HTML, or XML are all commonly used.</p>

                    <p>Any information can be sent on a network connection.  The software could be collaborative (e.g. chat), problem-solving (e.g. provide answer to question), content based (e.g. file or web server), or embedded (e.g. request data from a sensor or turn on a light).</p>

                    <p>When developing networking software, there are two types of models we can look at:</p>

                    <ul>
                    <li><p>Client-Server: The server receives requests from many clients, processes each one, and sends the responses back to the client.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Peer-to-Peer: A computer (peer) communicates directly to another commputer without going through a server.  In this model, there may be a server that is used by a computer to get address information for the other computer.</p></li>

                    <p>Data can be stored in many different formats.  An efficient method for storing information is in a database.  One common type of database is a relational database, which organizes the data into tables and relates them together using keys.  Libraries have been written to make it easy for the programmer to read and write to and from these databases.  Most relational databases support Structured Query Language, or SQL.  SQL is a language that allows the programmer to easily interact with the database.  Examples of relational databases include the following:  <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/" target="_blank">Oracle</a>, <a href="https://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/default.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft SQL Server</a>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html" target="_blank">SQLite</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/db2-database" target="_blank">IBM DB2</a>.</p>

                    <p>This module will have you create a web app using a framework that will generate web pages dynamically on the host server.  Django for Python and NodeJS for JavaScript are two common examples of web app frameworks.</p>
                    
                    <p>When a request is made to your web app, the Django framework will call the appropriate Python code (a function in your <code>views.py</code>) file).  The Python code will then parse the request and prepare a response.  To prepare a response, your code might read a database, download some data from another web server, or perform some calculations.  To produce the response, a template HTML file is populated with data created by the Python function.  The response is then automatically sent back by the Django framework.  Using a framework can reduce the time it takes to create web content.  In the case of Django, you also have the benefit of using the Python programming language to process requests.

Java requires the use of a compiler and a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which can both be obtained by installing the Java Development Kit (JDK).  Compiled code (often with a .class or .jar extension) will run on any computer that has a JVM.  Java contains a substantial library which includes many classes for data structures (Java Collection Framework), file management, and threading.  In Java, every file contains a single class.  A static main function is created in one of the classes and is used to provide a starting point for the program.</p>

                    <p>The Rust language is used for embedded and application development.  While similair to C or C++, it has improvements including memory management and variable ownership.  Support is provided for object-oriented methodologies as well as data structures and threading.  Rust comes with a build environment called Cargo which is used both for library management and building.</p>
