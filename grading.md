# Grading Instructions for CSE 310

## Module Result Grading

The Hello World module in Week 1 will follow these same rules.

1. Not Submitted
    * Canvas gives a grade of 0.  
    * Provide comment: "Grace period to correct this 0 is {2 weeks after due date}."
    
2. Missing GitHub or Video link
    * Give grade of 0
    * Explain to the student what happened.
    * Provide comment: "Grace period to correct this 0 is {2 weeks after due date}."

3. Github or Video link not working
    * Give grade of 0
    * Explain to the student what happened.  
    * Provide comment: "Grade period to correct this 0 is {2 weeks after due date}."

4. Video is missing code walkthrough or software execution demo
    * Give grade of 0
    * Explain to the student what happened.  
    * Provide comment: "Grace period to correct this 0 is {2 weeks after due date}."

5. Time is not reported for the Individual Module
    * Give grade of 0
    * Explain to the student what happened.  
    * Provide comment: "Grace period to correct this 0 is {2 weeks after due date}."

6. General
    * Use the rubric in Canvas for determining points.
    * Watch the video enough to establish:
        * They did a code walkthrough
        * They did a software execution demonstration
        * They completed the requirements of the module as they indicated in their checklist.  If they only missed one requirement you can still give full credit.  Additionally, consider the complexity of the project, the requirements they listed in the planning section, and the total hours worked.  Default to a more liberal grading approach for this item.  Use the "None but Attempted" if they just barely started on the project and that is confirmed by the hours they worked.
    * Review the Readme.md to ensure that all parts have been completed.  If one section is not completed with content, then give partial credit.
    * Review the code enough to establish:
        * They did write code
        * It is of sufficient size.  If they indicate in their checklist that it is < 100, use your judgement about whether this was sufficient for the module.  
    * Reflection points should be given so long as they completed that section
    * Stretch Challenge points should be given so long as they indicated a valid stretch challenge in this section.
    * If the grade is < 90%, then encourage student to resubmit and remind about available help.
    * If the grade is 100%, then provide the comment: "Great job!"

7. Resubmittals
    * If previous grade was not a 0, then re-grade.  
    * If previous grade was 0 and its before the grace period expires, then re-grade.
    * If previous grade was 0 and its after the grace period, then give a grade of 0.
